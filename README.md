## BakkesMod process automation
BakkesMod process automation allows [BakkesMod](https://www.bakkesmod.com/download.php) to start/stop automatically together with [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/).</br>
You will no longer need to run BakkesMod at the startup keeping it in background, or open it manually.

Once installed, the app will start running in background forever at any system boot, so its process is completely automatic and you won't have to do nothing with it. Don't worry, it uses very low memory without affecting performances.</br>
If you need to shut it down, you have to end the task through Task Manager (read the instructions below).
> <sup>Open Task Manager by pressing the `Ctrl+Alt+Canc` hotkey and selecting *Task Manager*, then click *More details* if needed; save your time by clicking *Name* (the title of the first column) to list all tasks in the alphabetical order, search for *BMpa.exe*, right-click it and select *End task*; close Task Manager.</sup>
### How to install
IMPORTANT! - first open BakkesMod and in its settings allow it to start minimized; close BakkesMod.</br>
Download the setup from the [*Releases* section](https://www.github.com/martinotecco/BakkesMod-process-automation/releases) (make sure to keep it even if your browser scanned it as risky, 'cause it's completely safe), open it, allow Windows to run it by clicking *More info* and *Run anyway*, then follow the steps.
