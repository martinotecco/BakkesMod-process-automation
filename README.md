# BakkesMod process automation
BakkesMod process automation allows [BakkesMod](https://www.bakkesmod.com/download.php) to start automatically when [Rocket League](https://www.rocketleague.com/) is being launched/stopped.
You will no longer need to run BakkesMod at the startup keeping it in background, or open it manually after opening Rocket League.

Once installed, the app will start running in background forever at any system boot, so its process is completely automatic and you won't have to do nothing with it.
In case you will need to shut it down, you will need to end the task through Task Manager (read the instructions below).
> <sup>open Task Manager by pressing the `Ctrl+Alt+Canc` hotkey and selecting *Task Manager*, then click *More details* if needed; save your time by clicking *Name* (the title of the first column) to list all tasks in the alphabetical order, search for *BMpa.exe*, right-click it and select *End task*, then close Task Manager.</sup>
## How to install
Download the setup from the [*Releases* section](https://www.github.com/martinotecco/BakkesMod-process-automation/releases) (please, make sure to keep it even if your browser scanned it as risky, 'cause it's completely safe), open it and follow all the steps.
